## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure your development environment is ready:

- Java (version used by project; latest stable is advisable)  
- Android Studio  
- Android SDK (with required API levels)  
- Emulator or Android device for testing  
- Git  

### Forking & Cloning

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.  
2. Clone your fork:

3. (Optional but recommended) Add upstream remote:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/harshshah6/SaavnMp3-Android.git
   ```

### Setting Up Locally

* Open the project in Android Studio (File ‚Üí Open) and point to the cloned folder.
* Allow Gradle to sync.
* Make sure you can build and run the app on emulator or device.
* If there are configuration files (API keys, local settings), ensure they are untracked (e.g. via `.gitignore`) and provide a template or guide for contributors.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

When you spot a bug:

* Search existing open/closed issues ‚Äî maybe it‚Äôs already reported.
* If not, create a new issue with:

  * A clear title
  * Steps to reproduce
  * Expected vs actual behavior
  * Logs, stack trace, screenshots
  * Device / OS version info

### Suggesting Enhancements

For new features or improvements:

* Create an issue labeled ‚Äúenhancement‚Äù (or similar).
* Describe:

  * What you want to do
  * Why it‚Äôs needed / use case
  * Any sketches or mockups
  * Possible implementation approach

### Submitting Pull Requests

1. Create a descriptive branch from `master`. Example:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Work on your change.

3. Commit with a meaningful message.

4. Push your branch to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. Open a Pull Request (PR) against the upstream `master` branch.

6. In the PR description, include:

## Coding Guidelines

### Style & Formatting

* Follow standard Java/Android naming conventions (e.g. `camelCase` for methods, `PascalCase` for classes).
* Keep methods short and single‚Äëpurpose.
* Avoid magic numbers ‚Äî use constants or resource files.
* Use resource files (`strings.xml`, `colors.xml`, `dimens.xml`) rather than hardcoded values.
* Include Javadoc-style comments for public classes/methods.
* Use `@Nullable`, `@NonNull` annotations where appropriate.
* Keep UI responsive ‚Äî avoid doing heavy tasks on the main thread.
* Use Android best practices (if applicable).

### Commit Messages

Use clear, conventional commit messages. A recommended structure:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

Optional detailed explanation.
```

Where `<type>` might be:

* `feat`: new feature
* `fix`: a bug fix
* `docs`: documentation changes
* `style`: formatting, whitespace, etc
* `refactor`: code structure changes (no feature/bug)
* `test`: adding or updating tests
* `chore`: build / tooling changes

Example:

```
feat(player): add shuffle mode for playback

Allows user to toggle shuffle mode in the player UI.  
```

### Branching

* `master` is the stable branch.
* Branch new work from `master` (e.g. `feature/xyz`, `fix/issue-123`).
* Avoid working directly on `master` for unreviewed changes.

### Testing
* Before submitting a PR, run all tests locally and ensure nothing is broken.

Don‚Äôt be discouraged by feedback ‚Äî it helps improve code quality and consistency.
